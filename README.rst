A set of utility data structures that (maybe) could fit in the ``collections`` package of Python's standard library.

Notes: ``collectionz`` is in alpha version and only compatible with Python 3. Support for Python 2 could be added later on ;)

Install by running::

    python3 -m pip install collectionz
